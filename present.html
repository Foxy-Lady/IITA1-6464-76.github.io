            <ul>
              <li>Living with my supportive partner & 4 dogs (Mon + Dad + Daughter + Son)</li>
              <li>Cooking meals at home, then doing dishes</li>

              My life has been changed a lot. Now I cook my own meals and do the dishes. 
              My partner and I work from home. Our spoiled 4 dogs get 3 or 4 walks a day. 
              With more than Full Time study, I spend a lot of hours on the studying and assignments. 
              I do have regular debation time with my partner regarding politics, world issues, socio-economic matters, climate changes, finances and arts. 
              I always struggle to find time to catch up with people.

            <h2> Study / Why RMIT </h2>
            <img src="rmit.png" alt="rmit">
            <ul>
              <li>Master's Public Policy</li>
              <li>Bachelor of Computer Science + Information Technology</li>
              <li>Coursera, Edx, CompTIA</li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
              I love studying. It does not mean I love exam or test. I just love learning something that I did not know yesterday and realize there are so many things that I do not know.
              Everyday I realize what I did not know yesterday. 
              This is the main reason I do study.
            </p>
            <p>  
              We use computer everyday. I would like to know the tools I use and heavily depend on for many different things. 
              Also, I would like to make robots and IoT products to make our lives more efficient. 
              Therefore, I need to study Computer Science. 
            </p>  
            <p>
              I am currently studying Master's Public Policy (my speicalty is Cybersecurity). I would like to be a real advisor and law maker with a real knowledge of Cybersecurity.
              Therefore, I study Cybersecurity. 

              My 24 hours are booked out. I could not afford to attend on-campus courses. RMIT offers online degree which is perfect for me. This is my primary reason to choose RMIT.
