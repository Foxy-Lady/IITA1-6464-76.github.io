          When I was young, I believed that I can fly, just like a superman. I wore my leggings then underwear, put the capes. Proudly, I jumped off from the balcony.
          My childhood has been FANTASTIC.

          Before meeting my partner, I had very simple life to save my 24 hours a day. 
          Everyday same meals at the same restaurants. Even I did not have to order, the restaurants knew what I want.
          To save time, I did not cook, no dishes to clean.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I love reading books (used to read 2 books weekly + 3 major newspapers everyday).
          1 Full time work + 1 Part time work + 1 Full time University degree

        <p> 
          When I thought I pay too much tax, I decided to enroll Bachelor of Accounting. When my work computer had a malware attack, I decided to study cybersecurity. 
          I decide when to complete the course which make incompletion at times. Once I gain the skills and knowledge, I do not think I need to obtain a piece of paper. 
          When I move one country to another country, I enroll a course to learn their culture and language.

        <p> 
           I managed several aged care homes in Australia. It means I was 24/7 on call. Once I used to flight out to Canberray / Sydney with the first flight on Mondays and back home to Adelaide with the last flight on Fridays. I lived at the hotels at that time.
           For the quality audit, I often walked into aged care homes at the middle of night without notice.
           I would like to be a doctor who save people's lives in a war-zone, then those people will make this world better. However, I realized that the people I saved can make this world worse.
