            <p>I was aware of that I am not a social/party person. It confirmed my thought, which made me worried about finding a group for my following assessment. </p>
            <p>My strategy to overcome my weakenss is to focus on the goal and assessment deadlines. </p>
            <p>It might take longer time to be a friend. However, I can work with people who have different professional and personal background. I do not have a trouble doing a team project as long as we have common goal and interests.</p>

              <li>Remember better by seeing charts, diagrams</li>
            </ul>
            <p> I am aware of my learming style - a visual and kinesthetic learner. I get annoyed by sounds easily. Therefore, I put my celler phone on mute most of days. My cell-phone is to make calls when I need. For example, I put mute on YouTube and prefer to read the subtitle if it is possible. </p>
            <p> It is important to let my teammates know and set up better communication channel.</p>   
            <p> I am a 'do' person rather than 'talk'. I would like to have short meetings and more time doing tasks. When I do not talk at the group meetings, my team needs to understand that I am listening, just not talking. I would not answer unless someone asks my opinion.</p>

            <p> I get tired when I have to interact with others too long without topic. If I find a group / peopl with same interests, I can be very talkative and interative.</p>
            <p> I can be inpatient when I have got things to do in my mind. Most of time, I am confidence and perform well under pressure. When I know I am struggling, I yell out for help quickly.</p>
            <p> Love learning new knowledges and skills, and participating activities. However, I prefer something can be done as a 'solo' instead of a group work or group sports.
                I need my own space and time while I need high stimulation. It might confuse many people because people do not know when I need my own space or stimulation.</p>
            <p> From the work perspective, I prefer all organized and planed well. However, I prefer no plan for my life. I love spotanous travelling, activities and migration.</p>
